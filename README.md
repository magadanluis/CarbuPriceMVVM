# CarbuPriceMVVM

This repository contains the source code of an Android mobile application. In addition to the source code, the apk (functional as of 05/01/2023) is also available. This application shows all the petrol stations in Asturias, with the price of each fuel. It also allows you to carry out filtering and search operations. Extending it to cover a greater number of Autonomous Communities is simple and it would only be necessary to modify one line of the application.

The MVVM pattern has been used. Devices capable of correctly supporting this application are those using API 14 through API 28. The following packages have been used to distribute the application classes:
- Controller: A class containing the application logic has been included in this package.
- Data: this package contains the classes used to carry out the data download from the corresponding API. In turn, it is divided into 4 other packages, which are:
  - Interfaces: contains the interfaces used, in this case only RestService.
  - remoteapi: contains the WebService class in charge of downloading the data and processing it.
  - repository: it contains the repository class, which will be accessed by the ViewModels to obtain the data. It should be noted that it uses a Singleton so that the same instance of the repository is used at all times.
  - utilities: this package contains the classes generated by the tool http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/.
- View: This package contains those classes related to the view of the application. This package is further divided into:
  - Activities: contains all classes related to the activities of the application.
  - Adapter: hosts the ViewAdapter to be used in the recyclerView.
  - Fragments: contains all fragments to be used in the application.
  - Interfaces: contains the interface used, which in this case corresponds to ListItemOnClick and handles the click event on a RecyclerView item.
- ViewModel: contains the ViewModels used in the application.

The following images show the different layouts of the application:
